# Fork
This is a fork of [https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js](xrpl.js) with a (probably) more up to date _definitions.json_ for new amendments such as Hooks.

# xrpl-hooks.js

This package includes the `xrpl-hooks` library. This repository uses a monorepo
layout. Please find the README for `xrpl-hooks` [here](https://github.com/RichardAH/xrpl.js#readme).

READMEs for other packages in this monorepo are located at the root of their
package, but since newcomers to XRPL are likely to want to use the `xrpl-hooks`
package this README is at the root of the project.
